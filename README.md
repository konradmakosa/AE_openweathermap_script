<br>
I have developed a suite of scripts utilizing Google Cloud, No Code applications, Adobe Scripts, Python and other tools to automate the generation of animated weather forecasts in Adobe After Effects. This system is designed to seamlessly integrate real-time data from OpenWeatherMap, ensuring that the forecasts are both accurate and visually engaging. <br>
My solution demonstrates a unique blend of technical proficiency in data handling and creative skills in animation, offering a sophisticated approach to presenting weather information. This project showcases my ability to innovate and streamline complex processes, making them both efficient and visually appealing.
